The dream of ‚Äúend-user programming‚Äù is still too far away. Let‚Äôs set our sights
on ‚Äúend-programmer programming‚Äù first.

### The Dream

There is a dream, almost an ancient prophecy, about computers that is as old as
computers themselves. Like a siren song, the dream has lured thousands of us to
chase it. It shimmers like a mirage, tantalizingly just over the horizon, yet
remains as elusive now as it ever has been. The road to the dream is littered
with so many dead prototypes of brilliant minds that many have given up on the
dream entirely. Yet in [some hearts](http://futureofcoding.org) the dream lives
on.

The dream is that the full power of computers be accessible to all, that our
digital worlds will be as moldable as clay in our hands, shaped fluidly and
continuously to serve each of our unique and particular needs. The dream is that
the full expressivity of programming will be accessible to all people, not just
the ~1% who spends years learning to code. The dream is the nothing short of
[the real computer revolution](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf).
The dream is _end-user programming_.

### Boiling the ocean

The gulf between end-user software and end-user programming is filled with an
ocean of thorny problems:

1. Understanding basic programming concepts (boolean logic, statements, state,
   loops, functions)
2. Using formal syntax
3. Setting up a development environment
4. Rendering
5. Deployment, hosting, logging, monitoring
6. Version control
7. Persistence (databases)

There are many amazing products and research prototypes that solve some of these
problems. There‚Äôs visual programming to make programming concepts more
intuitive, structured editors to help prevent syntax errors, auto-install online
coding environments, WYSIWYG rendering tools, and more! (Check out the
[Whole Code Catalog](https://futureofcoding.org/catalog/) for a selected list.)

Trying to tackle all of these problems at once is like trying to boil the ocean.
Yet only focusing on a sliver of the problem doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to the
original dream. The wary dreamer must somehow chart a path from here, the world
of today, that can bring us ever close to the whole dream.

### End-programmer programming

We can shift the audience. Instead of trying to achieve end-_user_ programming,
let‚Äôs start with end-_programmer_ programming. Today not even professional
programmers can control their own software! How can we expect to get from here
to end-user programming, without first achieving end-programmer programming?

At work, the programmer is a magician. She is just keystrokes away from anything
she can dream up. But at home, using apps made by big companies, programmers are
disenfranchised serfs, just like everyone else.

The task of end-programmer programming is empowering programmers to actually
control the software they use in their lives; not just the software they write
for work.

### Liberal software

We already have free & open-source software. So what is stopping us programmers
from achieving the dream of end-programmer programming?

  (Jonathan Corbet)

End-programmers need access to the deployed runtime environment, what Robert
"r0ml" Lefkowitz calls [‚Äúliberal software‚Äù](https://lwn.net/Articles/712376/).

Liberal software is also a pre-requisite to end-user programming! And that‚Äôs the
point of end-programmer programming: it‚Äôs a pit stop that allows us to solve
some of the same problems we‚Äôll have to solve for end-user programming, but
without having to deal with non-programmers at the same time.

The problems of liberal software are a tarball all on their own:

1. Mapping between different data schemas between versions of code
   ([Cambria](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/))
2. Managing code sharing between a Cambrian explosion of branches
3. Permissions for which users get to control what

We can limit the scope yet again: eschew whole, multiplayer apps in favor of
small, personal, [folk](https://maggieappleton.com/folk-interfaces) software,
little integrations, and mini-apps, like
[Spotify Rediscover](https://rile.yt/rediscover),
[Alert HN](https://alerthn.com/), [HN Replies](https://hnreplies.com/), and
[Small World](https://smallworld.kiwi/).

### An experiment: HN Follow

Because of excellent, free APIs and a sparse core interface, Hacker News has
spawned a whole ecosystem of mini-apps from readers to push-notifiers. Inspired
by our friend [Kartik](http://akkartik.name/)‚Äôs use-case, we decided to
contribute our own mini-app to the fray, built in the end-programmer style.

Our mini-app is called HN Follow ([hnfollow.com](http://hnfollow.com)) and it
allows you to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù authors on Hacker News and get email notifications
whenever they post. Our ‚Äúapp‚Äù really isn‚Äôt even an app at all: it just walks you
through creating the scripts to set up this query poll job.

![Screen Shot 2022-11-08 at 2.23.32 PM.png](./end-programmer-programming/screen_shot_2022-11-08_at_22332_pm.png)

Once setup, you can customize any of the JavaScript: write your own query,
choose a different schedule, filter results, format the email alert differently,
etc. You can even use the basic polling & email architecture to query any source
via its API, not just Hacker News.

Importantly, all this code is hosted and run for you. This is what makes it
liberal software: you have access to deploy to the same runtime the code was
written in.

When you sign up for HN Follow, we create an account for you on
[Val Town](https://val.town) (üëã¬†disclaimer: this is my new startup, a
collaborative cloud scripting environment) and install the scripts there.

### Val Town

[Val Town](https://val.town) is a place to write and run code online. You can
think of it as a ‚Äúrunnable Github Gists‚Äù or a ‚Äúuser-friendly AWS Lambda‚Äù. It
makes it incredibly easy to email yourself, persist small pieces of data, expose
functions and API endpoints, and create recurring jobs.

It‚Äôs a JavaScript editor and runtime built for the cloud: collaborative,
persistent, and (eventually)
[connected to APIs](https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1557746449600991232).
Use it to keep tabs on Hacker News or your other favorite watering holes,
reserve a table at a hot new restaurant, or shuffle data between one SaaS app
and another.

But the dream of Val Town is nothing short of end-user programming, with a
little detour through end-programmer programming. Come join as we inch along
towards the dream!
