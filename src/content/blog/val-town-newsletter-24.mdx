[Val Town Projects](#val-town-projects) have landed. If you like vals, you are going to _love_ Projects. We also shipped [Highlight to Edit with AI](#highlight-to-edit-with-ai), [redesigned Logs](#logs-redesign), enabled [public HTTP endpoints with private code](#public-endpoints-with-private-code), and much more.

This month, we're fixing many of the frictions y'all are reporting with Projects. Most excitingly, we're [building a CLI to let you edit your Val Town Projects locally](#roadmap), so you can use your favorite text editor and AI tools, like Cursor and Windsurf.

As always, the highlight of this newsletter is the [community vals](#-community-vals-and-projects). We're so inspired by the creativity of the things you're building. Keep it up!

## Val Town Projects

Val Town Projects unlock a whole new level of complexity for what you can build in Val Town.

In this video, I demo a Val Town Project that lets you download the source of any Val Town Project as a zip file. I fork the project, run it on my account, edit it to list a smaller, random number of projects, and send a pull request ‚Äì all in 60 seconds.

  <source src="/video/ProjectsDemo.mp4" />
</video>

Val Town Projects are groups of vals versioned collectively and deployed on our serverless platform. They support powerful workflows, such as feature branches and pull requests, that make it easy to build production applications with the classic Val Town simplicity and lightness.

Learn more about Val Town Projects in our [announcement post](../projects) and [docs](https://docs.val.town/projects/).

## Highlight to Edit with AI

We've [yet again](./fast-follow) built a popular way to code with AI into Val Town. Select text in any val and then click Edit or Cmd+L to ask AI to rewrite that section of code.

<video controls loop muted autoPlay class="image-rounded">
  <source src="/video/Highlight To Edit.mp4" />
</video>

This solves the problem with Townie rewriting too much or our completions not rewriting enough. Now you can highlight exactly what you want edited.

Huge shout-out to the folks at [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) for open-sourcing [this CodeMirror plugin](https://marimo-team.github.io/codemirror-ai/)!

## Logs Redesign

We've redesigned our logs to be easier to read and navigate ‚Äì with powerful filters to help you find what you're looking for fast.

<video controls loop muted autoPlay class="image-rounded">
  <source src="/video/ProjectLogsRedesign.mp4" />
</video>

The new logs pair beautifully with Val Town Projects, letting you view all the logs across a project at once.

## Public endpoints with private code

At long last, we've updated val privacy permissions to made it easy for you to create public HTTP endpoints, while keeping your code private.

<figure align="center">
  <Image
    style={{
      maxWidth: "600px",
      borderRadius: "8px",
      border: "1px solid var(--border)",
      overflow: "hidden",
    }}
    src={Privacy}
    alt="Val Privacy Menu"
  />
</figure>

Now `Private` keeps your code private, but your HTTP endpoint open. We've grandfathered old `Private` HTTP endpoints into a `Legacy Private` permission, which preserves the previous behavior by keeping the HTTP endpoint closed.

You can learn more about val privacy states [in our docs](https://docs.val.town/reference/permissions/). Thanks Robin Sloan, Matt Marcus, and Achille Lacoin for requesting this upgrade üôè

## Client-side errors in the HTTP preview

If your Val Town code throws an error on the server, you will see that in our beautifully-redesigned logs. But if your code throws an error on the client side, you'd have to seek in the browser console.

Now, we surface those client-side errors right in bottom of the HTTP preview, so you can see them right where you're working:

<figure align="center">
  <Image
    style={{
      borderRadius: "4px",
      border: "1px solid var(--border)",
      overflow: "hidden",
    }}
    src={ClientError}
    alt="Client-side error displayed in the HTTP preview"
  />
</figure>

To enable this, add this to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://esm.town/v/std/catch"></script>
```

We've instructed Townie to do this for you automatically for the last couple months (to enable its auto-detection of client-side errors), so some of your vals may already have it installed.

## Markdown editor line-wrapping

You can now choose to wrap lines in our Markdown editor.

  <source src="/video/WrapLines.mp4" />

## Projects API

The Val Town Projects Read API is out in beta. You can now list and retrieve public or your own projects and their branches and files. Here are the routes we currently support:

```http
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}
GET /v1/projects
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}/content
GET /v1/alias/projects/{username}/{project_name}
```

It's already been useful. For example, [the Project that lets you download Projects as zips](https://www.val.town/x/shouser/getProjectsAsZips) is built on our these routes.

You can view the [API docs](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/beta) and [SDK docs](https://github.com/val-town/sdk/blob/6f80c8470f055aa30c5c3cc34fcf715c81df1937/api.md#projects-1) to get started.

## Roadmap

We have [a new perspective building for AI coding at Val Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBfliNf9C4). We have paused all Townie development in favor of building out the Projects API and a CLI to edit vals locally, so you can edit vals from Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, vim, etc.

Here's what we're working on next:

- Projects Write API
- Val Town Projects CLI
- Redesigned account-wide logs
- Customizable `val.run` domains for Project HTTP vals
- Faster & scalable runtime
- Bug fixes to our in-browser TypeScript editor
- Improved code search
- Metrics to track your usage and limits
- Comments on pull requests
- Team accounts
- SOC2 compliance
- ‚Ä¶and much more!

Please [make feature requests and vote](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions?discussions) on what you'd like to see next.
