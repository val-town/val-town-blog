The core of Val Town is **running untrusted code**.
We take your TypeScript code and run it on a server, safely, quickly, and flexibly.

#### Safety

The default way to run untrusted code is _dangerously_. If you set up a
server, like Val Town's, that receives bits of JavaScript code and simply runs
all of the submitted code with Node.js, you'd be mining crypto and running a botnet
within the hour.

Code in Node.js has unfettered access to your system's environment variables,
filesystem, network, and much more. This access
is [routinely abused in supply-chain attacks](https://socket.dev/blog/inside-node-modules).
In response, the Node.js project is adding [a permissions system](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html)
that can allow & deny access to the filesystem and other resources,
but it's still experimental.

To safely run multiple vals, we need to sandbox and contain them:

- Vals need to be isolated from the system they're running on: they shouldn't
  be able to read from the filesystem or learn about environment variables.
- Vals should be isolated from each other: you shouldn't be able to affect
  anyone else's val's behavior, or read anyone else's information.

#### Speed

On the other hand, if you were to make every Val run in a full-fledged Docker
container, it'd be tremendously slow. You're booting up a whole Linux machine
with all the bells and whistles just to evaluate a few lines of code. It'd be
[pretty secure](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#conclusions), but
pretty slow.
You could create a pool of Docker containers, but the memory and devops overhead
would be significant.

#### Flexibility

Val Town gives you the flexibility of using modules and APIs from a number
of different ecoystems. If you've used
Node.js, great - your NPM modules should mostly work. Thanks to our current system,
a lot of DOM methods work too - you can parse query strings with [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) and use new APIs
like web-standard streams.

A way to square the safety + speed requirements
would be to use [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/), a standalone JavaScript
engine that's fast to start up and easily sandboxed with WebAssembly. But
we'd be miles away from NPM or Node compatibility.

### Tradeoffs

Safety, speed, and flexibility are often in conflict with each other. Some approaches
would be secure but limited, like QuickJS. Others would be flexible but bring
complexity and performance questions, like Dockerizing every Val. We need to find
a system that balances these concerns.

---

So, those are the properties we're aiming for. What have we tried so far? Buckle up.

#### Runtime 1: Node.js + vm (protoype phase)

The very first version of Val Town used Node.js’s [vm module](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html).
Schematically, running a val looked like this:

```ts
const [returnValue, logs, error] = vm.runInContext(`
  let resolveValue;
  let returnValue;
  let error;
  const logs = [];
  console.log = (log) => { logs.push(log); return undefined };
  try {
    ${replacedCode}
    returnValue = ${name}
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }
  [returnValue, logs, error];
`);
```

Now, the documentation for the vm module warns that "The node:vm module
is not a security mechanism. Do not use it to run untrusted code."
So it should be no surprise that this approach didn't last very long: it
was introduced in July 2022 and replaced on September 1st, well before any
serious usage of Val Town in production.

The Node.js vm module is incredibly convenient to use, but it was dangerous and
didn't check our boxes:

- Infinite loops in user code will take down your server
- It's easy to escape the sandbox and access sensitive environment variables
- You can't install NPM modules within the sandbox
- Scripts that run in the Node.js VM sandbox run in _script_ mode, not _module_
  mode, so you can't use `import` or `export`.

#### Runtime 2: Node.js + vm2

Due to the security problems with vm, we quickly switched
to [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2), a now-deprecated NPM module
that, unlike vm, aimed to be a security sandbox. VM2 still used
vm "under the hood", but it formalized all of the security workarounds
that people used to secure it. It used Proxies to try and prevent people
from escaping the sandbox. A familiar exploit in vm is something like
this, taken from the vm2 readme:

```ts
vm.runInNewContext('this.constructor.constructor("return process")().exit()');
```

vm2 prevented this attack by tweaking all of the objects exposed to the
VM context.

The vm2 maintainer valiantly fought to make this strategy robust, but in
the end it was impossible to add security to an unsecure construct,
and the [sandbox escapes kept coming](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security).
Eventually vm2 was deprecated by its maintainer and [isolated-vm](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm)
is the recommended replacement for Node.js users.

### Runtime 3: Deno + Workers

At this point, we started to learn some lessons. In broad strokes:

1. The Node.js vm module isn't a good base to build on.
2. It'd sure be nice to run vals as modules, not scripts.
3. Attempts to sandbox JavaScript _using JavaScript_, like vm2,
   are probably not going to work out.

Of course, we hadn't learned these lessons all the way - but we were
getting there.

At this point, I had become really interested in [Deno](https://deno.com/). Ever since
2018, when Ryan Dahl gave his excellent presentation on Node.js regrets,
the Deno project had prioritized the exact kind of sandboxing and security
we were interested in. A lot had changed since 2018 - they had even
ported the whole project from Go to Rust -
but [the permissions system](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/permissions#permissions-list) was a consistent focus, and
all signs pointed to it being very high-quality.

With Deno you can import modules and approve or disallow, one by one, their
requests to access the filesystem or environment. It's like going from code
running as root by default, to a capabilities-based system: iOS asking you
whether you want some app to see your location.

Better yet, Deno had a [Workers API](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/runtime/workers)
that mimics the Web Workers API in browsers: you can spin up separate threads,
with their own permissions, within an existing Deno process. It's super fast –
much faster than spinning up a new process. I idolize how [Cloudflare Workers works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) - spinning
up a V8 isolate per execution instead of a whole process. This looked
like the way to do it.

So we implemented a separate Deno server that only handled Val evaluation: giving
us three servers total (Remix for the frontend, Express backend, Deno server).
This elegantly provided isolation between Deno and Node.js, so Vals were much
farther away from environment variables or anything sensitive.

All in all, this was an improvement, but we still had further to go.

- Security problems were far fewer and had much less impact. Deno's sandboxing
  was a huge unlock. However, it was still possible to escape the sandbox, by
  doing things like spawning a worker inside of the worker. We were also still
  trying to preserve [a complex security model](https://blog.val.town/blog/restricted-library-mode/)
  in which JavaScript functions had their own environment variables and
  security isolation.

- However, Workers triggered [memory problems](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/18414)
  that made the evaluation server slower and slower over time until it restarted.
  We were spawning and killing a _lot_ of workers, and understandably this
  wasn't a typical usecase.
- Server isolation had a performance cost: for a val that powers a website, for each
  request we'd receive the request in the Express server, serialize it, send
  it to Deno, which would deserialize and operate on it, send the response to Express,
  which would then send it to the user.

Despite these issues, the switch to Deno was a big upgrade, and we were significantly
less affected by anything that untrusted code could do.

#### Runtime 4: Node.js + Deno processes

The current iteration of our runtime learns from the lessons so far:

- You can't really use JavaScript to build a JavaScript sandbox.
- Deno is a powerful tool for simple containment of functionality.
- Memory leaks are scary.

Right now, Vals run as temporary Deno subprocesses of a Node.js server.
The subprocess's code is tiny: it uses [node-deno-vm](https://github.com/casual-simulation/node-deno-vm),
a terrific module from [Kallyn Gowdy](https://github.com/KallynGowdy), which works by exposing a WebSocket
connection between Deno and Node.js and wrapping it in
a [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage)-style API.
The "guest" code that wraps vals is also now [public](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/c099aef89d1f0b0ea00137a45e2a2ea1),
though it's still an implementation detail and could change at any time.

While this gives far better isolation between user code and system code
than our previous vm and Worker-based strategies, it takes a little more
time to start up, so we use a pool of pre-initialized processes to
avoid that time penalty.

This strategy also gives the ability to have more fine-grained communication
with Deno, because it's based on WebSockets instead of a simple REST
HTTP request cycle. We can send multiple messages to control vals while
they're running, and receive multiple messages from them as they run.
This is key to how we just cut 100ms from typical val runtimes - more on
that on a future post.

Along with Runtime v4 was [Val Town v3, which included a slew of improvements](https://blog.val.town/blog/introducing-val-town-v3/),
like static import support, JSX, and web-standard JavaScript.
It was a vastly expanded set of JavaScript that "just worked,"
and worked pretty well.

#### What's next

As you can tell, we've been iterating fast. v4 is not the last version of
the Val Town runtime: we still have more ground to cover on all of the dimensions that we
care about. It's heartening to see others contribute to this discussion - Figma's
adoption of QuickJS, after
[using Realms was not secure enough](https://www.figma.com/blog/an-update-on-plugin-security/),
Amazon open-sourcing [Firecracker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/)
one of the components of Lambda, and Deno
sharing [details of how their Deploy product works](https://deno.com/blog/anatomy-isolate-cloud).

We want to learn from everyone. Vals should run instantly, securely, and everything should just
work. [Try out Val Town and see for yourself](https://www.val.town/) how
an instantly-deployed, zero-configuration script can work.

Oh, and if you read this and you have the answer and the experience and are the
one to unlock the next-gen runtime: [we're hiring](https://www.val.town/careers).
