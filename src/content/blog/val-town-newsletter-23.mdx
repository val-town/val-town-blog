🥳 Happy 2025! Last year, our product grew from a JavaScript playground to a stable FaaS (Functions as a Service) platform that thousands of engineers use in personal and professional contexts. Some highlights from 2024:

- Raised [our seed round](/blog/seed)
- [Max](https://maxmcd.com/), [Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/), [Justin](https://just-be.dev/), [Sophie](https://sophiehouser.com/) and [Charmaine](https://www.charmaineklee.com/) joined our team
- Our infra became [fast](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113#discussioncomment-10813787) and stable
- Launched [Townie](/blog/townie), a shockingly useful code assistant
- 23k of you made 135k vals that've run 214m times

We have big plans for 2025. By the end of this year, we aim to be a mature cloud platform that serious engineering organizations use for core infrastructure. Here's some of the highlights:

- Projects – groups of vals, files folders – with forks & 3-ways merges (currently in private beta)
- Scalable infra & usage-based billing
- Team accounts for companies to collaborate
- Improvements to Discovery, Search, Townie, Observability
- Continuing to [fast-follow with LLMs](/blog/fast-follow/)
- SOC 2

We have two new additions to the Val Town team! [Sophie](https://sophiehouser.com/) is a designer, programmer, and artist, who just moved from Berlin to join us here in Brooklyn. She's best-known for [a viral app she made as a teenager](https://sophiehouser.com/tampon-run-), but most recently worked with Nike and Delivery Hero. [Charmaine](https://www.charmaineklee.com/) is a technical product manager, with a deep background in developer tools. She's worked at Snapchat, Unity Labs, and Microsoft. We're thrilled to have them both on board.

## Val Projects Beta

Vals are great for small projects, but what if you want to build something bigger?

**Introducing <ins>Val Projects</ins>**, a new way to organize multiple vals, files, and folders into a single place. Where a Val Town Val is like a GitHub Gist, a Val Town Project is like a GitHub Repo.

<Image src={ProjectsExample} alt="Val Projects Example" />

Projects support:

- Static assets, like images, videos, css, html, etc
- Multiple files and folders
- Scoped environment variables (that code outside the project _can't_ access)

Projects will soon support:

- Branches, forking, pull requests, and three-way merges
- Townie, with the ability to understand and edit multiple files

We are building a new way to collaborate on code – without git or GitHub. That might sound crazy.
But many any of the web's Pro tools had to build their own version control, including Figma, Google Docs, and Notion.
We think that what we've come up with gives you 80% of the power of git with 20% of the complexity.
And if you need git & GitHub, it should be easy to sync your Val Project with a git repo. More on this soon.

Projects are currently in private beta. We're looking for more passionate Val Town users to try it out and give feedback. If you're a Pro user, please reach out to steve@val.town, and we'll add you to the beta.

## Templates

"What can I do with Val Town?" We get this question a lot, so we made [a page to help answer it](https://www.val.town/examples/use-cases).

<Image src={Templates} alt="Val Town Templates" />

[Check it out](https://www.val.town/examples/use-cases) and see if it sparks any ideas for you! Maybe you'll find a val that's perfect for your needs and you can fork it and make it your own. If you don't find what you're looking for, let us know. If you want to submit a val to be included, we'd love that too!

## Upgraded to Deno 2

[Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0) is out, and Val Town is now running it. We're currently on Deno v2.1.2, but you can always check which version we're running [here](https://www.val.town/v/std/deno_version).

In addition to some performance and security upgrades, Deno 2 also includes a couple exciting features:

- `process` and `Buffer` are now globally available, which means you don't have to import them anymore, which increases compatibility with Node.js code ([example](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/processBufferDeno2Example))
- WebAssembly imports are supported out-of-the-box ([example](https://www.val.town/v/just_be/deno2wasmExample))

## Updated pricing

We made three changes to our pricing:

1. We now have a yearly plan for $100! This is a 20% discount on our monthly plan 🥳
2. We've explicitly listed custom domains on the Pro plan, with a limit of 10
3. We've changed the val runs limits from per minute to per day. Now you get:
   - Free: 100k runs / day
   - Pro: 1m runs / day

<Image src={Pricing} alt="Val Town Pricing" />

One final word to the wise: we plan to increase our pricing soon, but will grandfather in all existing customers at the current price.
