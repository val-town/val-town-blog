Two months ago we [blogged about our fast-follow strategy for AI](./fast-follow/), whereby we would copy the best AI features we saw in other products into our product. Already, we've shifted our strategy quite a bit, and I wanted to share some of the thinking behind that.

For context, Val Town is a collaborative site to build and scale JavaScript apps. You can build websites, APIs, internal tools, crons, and more â€“ directly from your browser.

To briefly summarize [our strategy from two months ago](./fast-follow/), we were having success copying features from other AI products, like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Websim, Bolt, and others, into our product. The culmination of these efforts was [Townie](https://www.val.town/townie), a coding assistant that can build help you build fullstack apps on Val Town.

So what changed since then?

1. It's hard to keep up
2. If you can't beat em, join em

## It's hard to keep up

In the last _two months_ since our last blog post, we've seen [Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), [o3-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/), [GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/), [Cursor's $105M Series B](https://www.cursor.com/blog/series-b), Windsurf Wave [2](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-wave-2), [3](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-wave-3), and [4](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-wave-4), [Stackblitz raised $105m for Bolt.new](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stackblitz_today-were-announcing-1055m-in-funding-activity-7287877373394313216-xj8s/), [Gemini Code Assist](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-code-assist-free), . We're also continuing to see improvements across so many tools like [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [Aider](https://aider.chat/), [All Hands](https://www.all-hands.dev/), and [Repo Prompt](https://repoprompt.com/). And that's not even counting Deepseek, Grok or the other developments in AI more broadly.

To put hard numbers on it, the cost of o1-level intelligence fell 27x in the last 3 months. The cost of GPT-4 level intelligence fell 1000x in 18 months. For contrast, Moore's Law is a 2x improvement every 18 months, which has been the tidal wave powering our whole industry.

On a more practical level, we're a team of six full-time engineers. It'd be hard enough competing against these well-funded folks if we dropped everything and focused solely on AI. But we're also building a hosting and deployment service, and a collaborative coding website. We can't build Val Town properly, and keep up with AI. We would rather stay in our lane (deployment, collaboration) and be truly excellent at what we do, rather than be mediocre at everything.
