## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 📦 Git LFS

Make sure you have [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) (`brew install git-lfs`) installed before cloning. If you get errors when building you might be working with LFS references instead of downloaded images. Install git-lfs and re-clone the repo.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Private fork development

If you're a Val Town employee, working on a super secret blog post, here's how to develop on this repo in secret. Please only do this when really necessary, we prefer most blog posts to be developed in public.

1. `git lfs install`
2. Create a new branch off the main of this public blog repo `git checkout -b super-secret-branch`
3. Add the private fork as a remote: `git remote add private https://github.com/val-town/private-blog.git`
4. Push the new branch to the private fork: `git push private super-secret-branch`
5. Develop in secret on the private fork
6. When you're ready to publish, create a public remote on the private repo: `git remote add public https://github.com/val-town/val-town-blog.git`
7. Push the branch to the public repo: `git push public super-secret-branch`
8. Open a PR from the public repo to the main branch of the public blog repo
